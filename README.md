# SUICIDE DATA ANALYSIS:

AUTHORS: Sowmya Chenthi Kumar, Poojitha Gowthaman

## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS:

This project is an effort of understanding the trends in Suicide Dataset. This compiled dataset pulled from four other datasets linked by time and place, and was built to find signals correlated to increased suicide rates among different cohorts globally, across the socio-economic spectrum from 1985 to 2016.

The dataset is available here: [Suicide Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016) 

This analysis will give us insights about the reasons and timeframe that are the key reason behind these suicide rates.

Suicide statistics is probably an untouched area in the World Economic forum, but these statistics contribute to the future trend of the population of countries. They can help determine the proportion of population in different ages that gives sense of what the respective Governments can anticipate while planning their economic trends and investments. It can can provide insights on areas of improvement, specifically alluding to the 35 - 45 age group that we analyzed in the graphs above. Loosing that chunk of population can be put he economy out of balance. In reference to the top countries in 2015 with highest suicide numbers, United States tops the list followed by the Russian Federation. It is ironic to say how dictatorship beats democracy in determining the mental state of the population.From our analysis we also see suicide rates higher among males than females and the highest number of suicides occurred among the GI Generation. A sense of this data tells us where exactly in those 20 years did we lose a people and also throws some light on the time period. The distribution of population faceted by generations also gives us an idea of what we are looking at.
